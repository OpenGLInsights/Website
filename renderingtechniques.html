<h1>II Rendering Techniques</h1>

    <p>
      We can't possibly imagine a book about OpenGL without rendering, and neither could the authors of this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant&oacute;nio Ramires Fernandes and Bruno Oliveira provide a use case for the new OpenGL 4 tessellation pipeline through terrain rendering in their chapter &quot;GPU Tessellation: We Still Have a LOD of Terrain to Cover,&quot; providing an entirely GPU-based method for continuous level of detail maintaining a high level of fidelity to the original mesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      S&eacute;bastien Hillaire brings us to a parallel universe where rendering is defined by lines in his chapter &quot;Antialiased Volumetric Lines Using Shader-Based Extrusion.&quot; He comes back on the line primitives exposed by OpenGL and their issues before bringing perspective to line rendering thanks to two approaches: one based on the vertex shader stage and one based on the geometry shader stage for perspective correct and antialiased lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stefan Gustavson leads us close to new borders through his chapter &quot;2D Shape Rendering by Distance Fields,&quot; allowing perfectly antialiased contours. He is pushing his concept to font rendering and distance field-based effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin Encz analyses WebGL font rendering in his chapter &quot;Efficient Text Rendering in WebGL&quot; by describing canvas and bitmap-based methods. He concludes his chapter with a performance analysis with both the frame rate and the memory footprint in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dzmitry Malyshau discusses an approach inspired by Blender in his chapter &quot;Layered Textures Rendering Pipeline.&quot; He aims at providing more flexibility to the rendering pipeline to handle complex object materials so that artists may express their creativity during the producing while maintaining real-time performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles de Rousiers and Matt Pettineo present a method for &quot;Depth of Field with Bokeh Rendering.&quot; Their method, developed around OpenGL 4 hardware atomic counter, image load and store, and indirect draw, provides a level of performance for real-time application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Jochem van der Spek introduces a technique he calls &quot;Shadow Proxies,&quot; which provides, for appropriate scenarios, real-time soft shadows with color bleeding.
