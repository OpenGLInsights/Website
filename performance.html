<h1>IV Performance</h1>

    <p>
      When it comes to real-time graphics, performance is what defines the possible from the impossible; it is what sets the boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lack of performance might come from a lack of understanding of the platform we are working on. This may have a dramatic negative impact on the tile-based GPUs leading the OpenGL ES world. In his chapter, &quot;Performance Tuning for TileBased Architectures,&quot; Bruce Merry presents key tile-based GPU architecture features and how to take advantage of them. Jon McCaffrey follows this discussion in his chapter &quot;Exploring Mobile vs. Desktop OpenGL Performance,&quot; which shows the performance-scale differences between the mobile and desktop worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance is not only the concern of GPU architectures, it is also the direct result of how we write software. With GPUs whose performances increase at a faster rate than CPUs, we are more and more often CPU-bound, leaving us incapable to benefit from all the GPU power. S&eacute;bastien Hillaire, in his chapter &quot;Improving Performance by Reducing Calls to the Drivers,&quot; introduces some fundamental concepts to reduce CPU overhead with a legacy flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his chapter &quot;Indexing Multiple Vertex Arrays,&quot; Arnaud Masserann comes back to one of the most fundamental elements for GPU performance: how we submit vertex array data to the GPU. He provides a directly applicable method to ensure that vertex indexing will be used even on assets not organized this way, like COLLADA geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, sometimes we are left with no choice: to scale performance, we must scale the number of GPUs used for rendering. This is the topic of Shalini Venkataraman in her chapter &quot;Multi-GPU Rendering on NVIDIA Quadro.&quot; She explains how to efficiently use multiple GPUs for rendering and integrate their work to build the final image.
